# Advent of Code Solutions

A collection of all of my advent of code stuff in every language I know or am learning/want to learn.

I realize that my current file structure is hot garbage and that it'd be better to follow a `Year/day/language` format, because then I'd be able to have one input and test file per day, but that'll take some work to change.

**Initial Solutions:**
* 2015: Python
* 2016: N/A
* 2017: Rust
* 2018: N/A
* 2019: N/A 
* 2020: N/A
* 2021: C++
